# Trinity Capital Lesson Engine - Architecture Plan

This document provides a high-level yet actionable plan for building the Trinity Capital Lesson Engine. It is intended to guide GitHub Copilot and developers by outlining system behavior, expected data flows, and integration rules.

---

## ðŸ”— Dependencies (Interconnected Systems)

1. **Student App**

   - Uses: `server.js`, `Frontend/Javascript/*`, `index.html`
   - Purpose: Delivers interactive UI and app features (transfers, budgets, bills, etc.)

2. **Lesson Server**

   - Uses: `server.js`
   - Purpose: Hosts, evaluates, and tracks active lesson sessions.

3. **Teacher Dashboard**

   - Uses: `script.js`
   - Purpose: Sends lesson conditions; receives performance and health data.

4. **Lesson Renderer**
   - Uses: `lessonRenderer.js`
   - Purpose: Pulls and renders lesson content from MongoDB Atlas DB.

---

## ðŸ‘£ Student Flow Summary

### 1. Lesson Access

- Student logs in to the app.
- Unit 1 is always visible by default.
  - **If teacher has custom Unit 1**, it takes precedence unless reverted to default.

### 2. Lesson Gating

- Students must complete the current lesson before accessing the next.
  - Attempting to skip triggers a friendly prompt guiding them to the next required lesson.

### 3. Lesson Content Rendering

- Headers + text blocks are grouped.
- Multiple text blocks with no header appear standalone.
- Consecutive headers render independently.

### 4. Instruction Generation

- Upon reaching the instruction page, the engine interprets the lesson's conditions.
- It generates personalized in-app instructions (e.g., "Use the Bills section to set up a recurring $300 rent payment").

---

## ðŸ§  Core System Responsibilities

The engine is activated by **a single function call** from the frontend after any financial action. This function performs:

1. **Action Type Identification**

   - Recognizes student behaviors (e.g., deposit, bill creation, transfer).

2. **Active Lesson Tracking**

   - Determines which lesson is in progress.

3. **Condition Evaluation**

   - Matches actions against conditions from teacher-created lessons.

4. **Instruction & Challenge Generation**

   - Uses instruction templates mapped to lesson conditions.
   - Adapts dynamically based on goal and context.

5. **Completion Validation**

   - Checks whether all required conditions have been met.
   - Locks lesson if complete and unlocks the next one.

6. **Grading & Reporting**
   - Uses grading rules (see below).
   - Updates DB with:
     - Grade
     - Lesson status
     - Student health
   - Notifies teacher dashboard.

---

## ðŸ§± Architecture Principles

- **Simple**: Keep the lesson engine modular and maintainable.
- **Dynamic**: Avoid hard-coded logic; work off data schemas.
- **Non-Invasive**: No changes to HTML, CSS, or unrelated systems.
- **Template-Driven**: Reuse smart condition â†’ action templates.
- **Passive Checkpoints**: Some conditions are evaluated at login, action events, or every 5â€“10 minutes.

---

## ðŸ“Š Grading & Lesson Completion

- **100%** = All conditions met + no mistakes
- Use Texas public high school grading equivalency for partial completion
- Grading logic is modular and triggered _only when lesson is complete_

---

## ðŸ“¦ Recommended Functional Breakdown

```ts
// Pseudocode (not actual implementation)
function onAppAction(actionType, payload) {
  const lesson = getCurrentLessonForStudent();
  const conditions = lesson.conditions;

  matchConditions(actionType, payload, conditions);
  updateStudentState(payload);
  if (allConditionsMet(lesson)) {
    gradeLesson(lesson);
    lockLesson();
    unlockNextLesson();
    syncWithTeacherDashboard();
  }
}
```

---

## ðŸ§ª Example Use Case

> **Condition**: If student creates a bill  
> **Action/Challenge**: Save $500 into savings

### What happens:

1. Student creates a bill
2. Engine detects `bill_created` condition
3. Engine issues `challenge_save_amount`
4. Student saves $500
5. Lesson is marked complete
6. Score submitted, dashboard updated

---

## ðŸ“Œ Developer Requests

1. Keep logic minimal & clean
2. Ensure perfect compatibility with lesson builder schema
3. Avoid hard-coded examples
4. Use reusable instruction/action templates
5. Reference all condition/action types from `LESSON_BUILDER_ENHANCEMENTS.md`
6. Promote action-based grading (not reading/memorizing)
7. Don't modify existing HTML/styling
8. Don't alter unrelated systems
9. Do **not restart servers** â€” use `curl` or live reload where possible
10. Stop processing and report clearly if a structural system change is required

## ðŸ”„ New Requirements

### ðŸ”§ 1. Update Lesson Builder Schema Integration

Update the Teacher Dashboard lesson builder to use the **new JSON schema** now implemented in premade lessons. This ensures consistency across lessons and allows both premade and teacher-generated content to follow the same structure.

### ðŸ“¦ 2. New JSON Schema

```json

### âœ… 3. Schema Usage Instructions

- When teachers create or edit a lesson, the lesson data must be saved using this structure.
- When teachers view or manage lessons, their dashboard should **search for all units/lessons under this schema**.
