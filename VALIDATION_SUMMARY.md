## How It Works

1. **When a student clicks any submit button**, the system:

   - Validates all inputs using the validation utilities
   - Shows loading state on the button
   - Displays specific error messages if validation fails
   - Processes the request if validation passes
   - Shows success/error notifications based on server response
   - Clears the form on success
   - Resets button state

2. **Students will now see**:
   - Clear error messages for invalid inputs
   - Success confirmations when operations complete
   - Visual feedback during processing
   - Professional-looking notifications instead of browser alerts

The validation system is now fully integrated and will provide students with clear feedback for all their banking operations!
