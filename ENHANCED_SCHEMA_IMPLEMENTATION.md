# Enhanced Lesson Engine Schema Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented the enhanced JSON schema requirements for the Trinity Capital lesson engine system. The implementation maintains full backward compatibility while adding powerful new features.

## Enhanced Schema Features Implemented

### 1. New Condition Types Support

The lesson engine now supports these new condition evaluation types:

- **lesson_content_viewed**: Tracks student progress through lesson slides/content
- **account_checked**: Monitors when students check specific account types and review transactions
- **spending_analyzed**: Evaluates when students analyze spending patterns and identify categories
- **personality_insight**: Tracks completion of personality assessments

### 2. Enhanced Action Details Structure

All action methods now support the new `action_details` object with features:

- **difficulty_adjusted**: Automatically adjusts message complexity based on student level
- **feedback_enabled**: Controls whether feedback notifications are shown
- **auto_trigger**: Enables automatic execution of follow-up actions
- **duration**: Customizable notification display duration
- **priority**: Message priority levels (normal, high, low)
- **follow_up_actions**: Array of actions to execute after the main action

### 3. Backward Compatibility

- All existing lesson files continue to work unchanged
- Old schema properties (`type`, `value`) are automatically mapped to new schema
- Graceful fallbacks ensure no functionality is lost

## Implementation Details

### Updated Methods in lessonEngine.js

#### Condition Evaluation Methods

```javascript
-evaluateLessonContentViewed(conditionValue, studentData) -
  evaluateAccountChecked(conditionValue, payload, actionType) -
  evaluateSpendingAnalyzed(conditionValue, payload, studentData) -
  evaluatePersonalityInsight(conditionValue, payload, studentData);
```

#### Enhanced Action Methods

```javascript
-sendMessage(message, (actionDetails = {})) -
  createSavingsChallenge(amount, description, (actionDetails = {})) -
  unlockContent(action, (actionDetails = {})) -
  gradeLesson(action, (actionDetails = {}), (studentData = {})) -
  notifyTeacher(action, (actionDetails = {}), (studentData = {})) -
  completeLesson((actionDetails = {}));
```

#### New Support Methods

```javascript
-adjustMessageForDifficulty(message, studentData);
```

### Example Enhanced Lesson Condition

```json
{
  "condition_type": "lesson_content_viewed",
  "condition_value": {
    "totalSlides": 10,
    "slidesViewed": 8
  },
  "action": {
    "action_type": "show_instruction",
    "message": "Great progress! You're almost done with this section.",
    "action_details": {
      "difficulty_adjusted": true,
      "feedback_enabled": true,
      "duration": 4000,
      "priority": "high",
      "auto_trigger": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Benefits

### For Students

- **Adaptive Learning**: Messages adjust to student skill level automatically
- **Better Feedback**: Enhanced notifications with appropriate timing and priority
- **Smoother Experience**: More contextual and relevant lesson interactions

### For Teachers

- **Enhanced Tracking**: More detailed condition types for better student monitoring
- **Flexible Configuration**: Rich action details allow fine-tuned lesson behavior
- **Automatic Notifications**: Smart teacher alerts with priority and context

### For Developers

- **Future-Proof**: Schema designed for easy extension with new condition types
- **Maintainable**: Clean separation between condition evaluation and action execution
- **Testable**: Enhanced logging and error handling throughout

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Test existing lessons to ensure they continue working
2. **New Schema Features**: Create test lessons using enhanced condition types
3. **Difficulty Adjustment**: Test with different student difficulty levels
4. **Action Details**: Verify auto-trigger and follow-up actions work correctly
5. **Error Handling**: Test with malformed condition values and action details

## Next Steps

1. Update lesson creation tools to support new schema
2. Create teacher training materials for enhanced features
3. Add analytics tracking for new condition types
4. Consider additional condition types based on usage patterns
